10|What are the top 3 blockers?|"Here are the **top 3 blockers impacting progress toward next quarter’s strategic priorities**:

---

### **1. Resource Constraints**
- **What it means:** Shortage of skilled personnel, limited budget flexibility, and delays in securing required tools or infrastructure.
- **Impact:** Slows down cloud upgrades, AI analytics deployment, and CRM rollout.
- **Mitigation:** Accelerate hiring for critical roles, pre-approve vendor contracts, and allocate contingency funds.  
[1]

---

### **2. Unclear or Evolving Requirements**
- **What it means:** Ambiguity in feature specifications, shifting priorities, or incomplete acceptance criteria.
- **Impact:** Causes rework in product development and delays in customer experience initiatives.
- **Mitigation:** Strengthen backlog grooming, enforce change control, and ensure stakeholder alignment early.  
[1]

---

### **3. Communication Breakdowns**
- **What it means:** Gaps in information flow between distributed teams, vendors, and leadership.
- **Impact:** Leads to missed dependencies, delayed decisions, and misaligned execution.
- **Mitigation:** Implement structured status reporting, use centralized collaboration tools, and schedule regular cross-functional syncs.  
[1]

---

Would you like me to **prepare a risk mitigation plan with owners and timelines for these blockers**, or **create a dashboard to track blocker resolution progress**?
