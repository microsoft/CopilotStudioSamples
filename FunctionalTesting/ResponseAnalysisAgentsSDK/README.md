# CopilotStudio Client

## Prerequisite

To set up this sample, you will need the following:

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.9 or higher
2. An Agent Created in Microsoft Copilot Studio or access to an existing Agent.
3. Ability to Create an Application Identity in Azure for a Public Client/Native App Registration Or access to an existing Public Client/Native App registration with the `CopilotStudio.Copilots.Invoke` API Permission assigned. 

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.9 or higher
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) (for local development)
- An Agent created in Microsoft CopilotStudio or access to an existing Agent.
- Ability to create an Application Identity in Azure for a public client/native App Registration or access to an existing one with the `CopilotStudio.Copilots.Invoke` API persmission assigned.

## Authentication

The CopilotStudio Client requires a User Token to operate. For this sample, we are using a user interactive flow to get the user token for the application ID created above. Other flows are allowed.

> [!Important]
> The token is cached in the user machine in `.local_token_cache.json`

## Create an Agent in Copilot Studio

1. Create an Agent in [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com)
    1. Publish your newly created Copilot
    2. Goto Settings => Advanced => Metadata and copy the following values, You will need them later:
        1. Schema name
        2. Environment Id

## Create an Application Registration in Entra ID

This step will require permissions to create application identities in your Azure tenant. For this sample, you will create a Native Client Application Identity, which does not have secrets.

1. Open https://portal.azure.com 
2. Navigate to Entra Id
3. Create a new App Registration in Entra ID 
    1. Provide a Name
    2. Choose "Accounts in this organization directory only"
    3. In the "Select a Platform" list, Choose "Public Client/native (mobile & desktop) 
    4. In the Redirect URI url box, type in `http://localhost` (**note: use HTTP, not HTTPS**)
    5. Then click register.
4. In your newly created application
    1. On the Overview page, Note down for use later when configuring the example application:
        1. The Application (client) ID
        2. The Directory (tenant) ID
    2. Go to API Permissions in `Manage` section
    3. Click Add Permission
        1. In the side panel that appears, Click the tab `API's my organization uses`
        2. Search for `Power Platform API`.
            1. *If you do not see `Power Platform API` see the note at the bottom of this section.*
        3. In the *Delegated permissions* list, choose `CopilotStudio` and Check `CopilotStudio.Copilots.Invoke`
        4. Click `Add Permissions`
    4. (Optional) Click `Grant Admin consent for copilotsdk`

> [!TIP]
> If you do not see `Power Platform API` in the list of API's your organization uses, you need to add the Power Platform API to your tenant. To do that, goto [Power Platform API Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/programmability-authentication-v2#step-2-configure-api-permissions) and follow the instructions on Step 2 to add the Power Platform Admin API to your Tenant

## Instructions - Configure the Example Application

With the above information, you can now run the client `CopilostStudioClient` sample.

1. Open the `env.TEMPLATE` file and rename it to `.env`.
2. Configure the values based on what was recorded during the setup phase.

```bash
  COPILOTSTUDIOAGENT__ENVIRONMENTID="" # Environment ID of environment with the CopilotStudio App.
  COPILOTSTUDIOAGENT__SCHEMANAME="" # Schema Name of the Copilot to use
  COPILOTSTUDIOAGENT__TENANTID="" # Tenant ID of the App Registration used to login, this should be in the same tenant as the Copilot.
  COPILOTSTUDIOAGENT__AGENTAPPID="" # App ID of the App Registration used to login, this should be in the same tenant as the CopilotStudio environment.
```

3. After installing the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, run the CopilotStudioClient sample using

```sh
python -m src.main
```

This should challenge you to login and connect to the Copilot Studio Hosted agent, allowing you to communicate via a console interface.
