# AI Custom Integration

This folder collects samples of custom AI integrations. The idea is that you can call your custom code via HTTPs within a Copilot Studio Action. By doing so, you can leverage the full flexibility of invoking Azure components in AI Foundry or other AI Services, as well as leveraging AI orchestrators like Semantic Kernel and LangChain.
