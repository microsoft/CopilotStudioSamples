kind: AdaptiveDialog
modelDescription: |-
  You will respond to requests about the cost center of direct reports of the user making the request. Your information is retrieved from Workday, and will only contain results regarding the user's direct reports. There is no information available for anyone who isn't a direct report, and being a direct report means that the individual is not a manager, spouse, sibling, or any other relationship to the requestor, and only means that they report to the requestor. The resulting data will contain a list of employees who report to the requestor and will contain their company name and cost center. You must NOT give data if you do not have enough info.
  
  Example invalid requests:
  "What is my manager's cost center?"
  "What is my sister's cost center?"
   
  Example valid request:
  "What is the cost center of my direct reports?"
  
  Your output **must** be a nested list in markdown language based on the data contained in the {Topic.workdayResponseTable} variable
