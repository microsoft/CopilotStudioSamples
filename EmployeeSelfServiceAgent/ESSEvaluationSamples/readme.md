This repo contains guidance and resources for [evaluating the Microsoft Employee Self‑Service (ESS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/employee-self-service/evaluations) agent built in Copilot Studio. It includes a detailed overview of how to create test sets, run automated evaluations, interpret results, and build a repeatable quality strategy for ESS deployments. The documentation covers knowledge tests, data and topic tests, conversational quality checks, and recommended practices for building custom golden query sets. Use these materials to assess accuracy, safety, grounding, and end‑to‑end behavior of your ESS agent and to support a consistent, scalable evaluation workflow across HR and IT scenarios.
