# What is the implementation guide?

The Copilot Studio implementation guide offers in-depth guidance, best practices, and reference architectures and patterns. It is designed to help customers, partners, and Microsoft teams plan, design, and review copilot projects and architectures for a successful implementation journey.

The implementation guide also provides a framework to do a 360-degree review of a project. Through probing questions, it highlights potential risks and gaps, aims at aligning the project with the product roadmap, and shares guidance, best practices and reference architecture examples.
Users of the implementation review are guided at each step of the journey with the side pane that provides more context on the questions or features, shares best practices, and includes links to additional resources.

Inspired by the [Success by Design](https://learn.microsoft.com/dynamics365/guidance/implementation-guide/success-by-design) framework – a tried and tested Microsoft methodology used for Business Applications implementations – this format aims to detect bad patterns, identify risks, share best practices, and showcase example implementations.
