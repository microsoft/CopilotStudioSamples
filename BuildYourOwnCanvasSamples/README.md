# Customize the look and feel of your bot chat canvas

Power Virtual Agents allows you customize the look and feel of your bot's chat canvas. Our chat canvas builds on the highly customizable [Bot Framework Web Chat canvas](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat). This article explains how you can customize your canvas and connect it with a Power Virtual Agents bot.

>Creating a custom canvas requires software development. Our guidance here is intended for experienced IT professionals, such as IT admins or developers who have a solid understanding of developer tools, utilities, and IDEs.
